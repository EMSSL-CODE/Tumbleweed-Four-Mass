One point of note is that the normal force of the rover is not constant due to the motion of the masses during the motion of the rover. Figure \ref{fig:normal} demonstrates the cyclic nature of the normal force as it follows the mass motion for a steady state rotation of the rover. It can be seen that the peaks of the masses are closely aligned withe the peaks of the normal force oscillations. While the amplitude of the oscillations is small, the effect is still propagated to the rover in terms of the rolling resistance force and thus the normal force of the rover cannot be assumed to be soley equal to that of the rover weight.
